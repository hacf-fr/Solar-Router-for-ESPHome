# Solar Router for ESPHome 

The **Solar Router for ESPHome** is a DIY project aiming to provide specialized hardware device and software tailored for optimizing solar energy utilization. It performs real-time monitoring and intelligent surplus energy management to effectively channels excess solar energy to designated loads like water heaters or frost protection systems. 

Key features include dynamic energy routing algorithms, a choice of power meter source (local or remote ...), multiple regulators (with triac or relay ... ), and a seamless integration with [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) via [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) firmware. 

This integration enables users to effortlessly monitor and control the router's functionality within the HomeAssistant ecosystem, facilitating streamlined energy management and automation.
