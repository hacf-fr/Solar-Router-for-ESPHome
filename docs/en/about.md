# About

This project was created by [Xavier Berger](https://github.com/XavierBerger). Here is the original "About" content:

> "In early 2024, I built a solar router following the instructions from [F1ATB](https://f1atb.fr). While this solar router is very versatile, I wasn't satisfied with its integration with [HomeAssistant](https://homeassistant.io).  
> I then discovered the work of [Rem81](https://domo.rem81.com/), who created a solar router directly using [ESPHome](https://esphome.io). I thought it must be possible to combine the modularity of F1ATB's router with the seamless Home Assistant integration of an ESPHome device... and this project was born."

In early 2026, this project was transferred to the **Home Assistant Communauté Francophone** association. The project is now available at [https://github.com/hacf-fr/Solar-Router-For-ESPHome](https://github.com/hacf-fr/Solar-Router-For-ESPHome) and benefits from collaborative development by [volunteer developers](https://github.com/hacf-fr/Solar-Router-for-ESPHome/graphs/contributors). Thank you to everyone involved.
